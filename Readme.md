SudoDEM: A Discrete Element Code for Non-spherical Particles

SudoDEM (https://sudodem.github.io) is specifically designed for modeling non-spherical particles using discrete element method (DEM), which inherits 
a basic framework of an open-source DEM code, YADE (https://yade-dem.org). The project aims to develop a robust 2/3D DEM code for convex particles, e.g., polyhedrons, super-ellipsoids, poly-superellipsoids, cylinders and cones for 3D, disks and superellipses for 2D. The concave shapes can be constructed by grouping the convex ones with the typical "clump" technique. Please feel free to post your questions on the forum at https://sudoforum.discourse.group, if you have any one.
